I love my Razer Naga mouse, but the software for OS X is horrendous. Do I really need a cloud connected mouse driver? No. I don't. Nobody does. 

Nobody likes complainers either, so I did something about it.

This is a `private.xml` file for Karabiner and an AppleScript to adjust mouse speed. Don't have Karabiner? It's pretty awesome. [Download it here](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). 

## Installation
- [Read the instructions here](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/xml.html.en) to install the `private.xml` file. If you want Mouse 5 & 4 to adjust the mouse speed, read below.

## Getting Mouse 5 & Mouse 4 to adjust speed
1. Download tccutil
2. Move `mouse.applescript` to ~/bin
2. Run `sudo tccutil.py -i /usr/bin/osascript`
3. Reboot
4. ??
5. Profit!!!
